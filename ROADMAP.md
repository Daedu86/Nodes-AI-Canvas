# Nodes product roadmap

Nodes is evolving toward a stable AI decision workspace for teams that need to explore alternatives, preserve evidence, compare outcomes, and carry decisions into future work.

This roadmap communicates direction, not delivery guarantees. Priorities may change based on product evidence, security requirements, operating cost, and contributor capacity.

## Product principles

1. **Exploration should remain reversible.** Branching must preserve alternatives instead of overwriting them.
2. **Context should be visible and reusable.** Important evidence, plans, drafts, and decisions belong on Canvas rather than in scrollback.
3. **Comparison should be explicit.** Arena should make trade-offs and winner selection understandable.
4. **Decisions should survive the conversation.** Project memory and Context Builder should carry outcomes into later sessions.
5. **Cloud features must fail safely.** Authentication, ownership, credentials, quotas, and persistence are enforced server-side.

## Available today

- [x] Branching conversations from user and assistant messages.
- [x] Persistent Canvas with text, code, image, file, and prompt artifacts.
- [x] Context and output links between messages and artifacts.
- [x] Branch and session comparison in Arena.
- [x] Projects, project memory, and Context Builder.
- [x] Secure project invitations with owner, editor, and viewer roles.
- [x] Per-user OpenRouter credentials with production encryption support.
- [x] Local file persistence and Supabase cloud persistence.
- [x] Unit, coverage, E2E, accessibility, security, bundle, and Canvas performance gates in CI.
- [x] Per-user first-run workspace guide for the primary Chat and Canvas workflow.
- [x] Reproducible seeded product demo for presentations and evaluations.

## Now — product readiness

The current focus is making the product understandable, reliable, and evaluable by people who did not build it.

- [x] Public product narrative, screenshots, architecture overview, and 60-second demo guide.
- [x] One-command local demo workspace.
- [x] Public contribution, security, issue, and pull-request templates.
- [x] Add per-user first-run onboarding for question → Canvas → structured context.
- [x] Add automated axe, focus-trap, focus-restoration, and inert-panel checks in Chromium and Firefox.
- [ ] Verify and publish a stable public demo URL with a controlled demo account or read-only experience.
- [ ] Extend onboarding through Arena winner selection and project memory reuse.
- [ ] Add reusable starter projects for product discovery, research synthesis, technical design, and writing.
- [ ] Complete manual keyboard and screen-reader review for Arena and project flows.
- [ ] Improve responsive behavior for smaller laptop and tablet layouts.

## Next — team workflow

- [ ] Activity history for important project changes and promoted memory.
- [ ] Comments or review notes attached to branches, artifacts, and Arena comparisons.
- [ ] Import and export for portable sessions and projects.
- [ ] Project templates and organization-level defaults.
- [ ] Better model-cost and quota visibility before and after a run.
- [ ] Administrative controls for plans, usage, providers, and support workflows.
- [ ] More detailed recovery flows for conflicting edits and interrupted model runs.

## Later — platform capabilities

- [ ] Real-time multi-user collaboration where the operating cost and conflict model are justified.
- [ ] Public API and scoped automation tokens for project and session workflows.
- [ ] Extensible artifact types and workflow integrations.
- [ ] Evaluation datasets for comparing models and prompt strategies inside Arena.
- [ ] Optional organization knowledge sources with explicit permissions and provenance.
- [ ] Deployment profiles beyond the current Vercel and Supabase reference architecture.

## What is intentionally not promised

Nodes does not currently claim:

- fully synchronous real-time editing;
- guaranteed compatibility with every model provider;
- unlimited hosted inference funded by the deployment owner;
- a stable `1.0` data format;
- autonomous agents operating without explicit permissions and quotas.

## How priorities are chosen

A roadmap item moves forward when it improves at least one of these outcomes without materially weakening another:

- time to understand the product;
- quality and traceability of decisions;
- reuse of context across sessions;
- collaboration safety;
- reliability and recoverability;
- deployment and operating simplicity;
- measurable user demand.

Feature requests should explain the user problem, current workaround, expected outcome, and why the capability belongs in Nodes. Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) to propose an item.
